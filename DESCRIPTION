Description: The correction is achieved under the assumption that non-migrating cells of the essay approximately form a quadratic flow profile due to frictional effects, compare law of Hagen-Poiseuille for flow in a tube. The script fits a conical plane to give xyz-coordinates of the cells. It outputs the number of migrated cells and the new corrected coordinates.
